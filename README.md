List of all available operations in this node.

## Credentials

This node uses a custom credential type to connect to your Twake instance via the Cozy Stack. You‚Äôll need :

- A Twake instance installed locally
- A permissions token generated from your local stack

> **Note:**
> Currently, token generation is only possible via a locally installed Cozy Stack using this script :

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# === Config ===
INSTANCE_URL="YOUR_INSTANCE_URL" # https://yourinstance.mycozy.cloud or https://yourinstance.twake.linagora.com
INSTANCE_NAME="YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME" # yourinstance.mycozy.cloud or yourinstance.twake.linagora.com
APP_NAME="n8n" # Mandatory

# === Get first token via Cozy CLI ===
FIRST_TOKEN=$(cozy-stack instances token-cli "$INSTANCE_NAME" io.cozy.files )

if [ -z "$FIRST_TOKEN" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Impossible to fetch first token, verify your cozy-stack installation"
  exit 1
fi

# === Do the POST request to /permissions ===
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "$INSTANCE_URL/permissions?codes=$APP_NAME" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIRST_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "io.cozy.permissions",
      "attributes": {
        "permissions": {
          "io.cozy.files": {
            "description": "Access your files",
            "type": "io.cozy.files",
            "verbs": ["ALL"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }')

# === Extract the permissions token ===
PERMISSIONS_TOKEN=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r ".data.attributes.codes[\"$APP_NAME\"]")

if [ "$PERMISSIONS_TOKEN" == "null" ] || [ -z "$PERMISSIONS_TOKEN" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Final token not found"
  exit 1
fi

# === Output final token ===
echo "$PERMISSIONS_TOKEN"
```

This will generate the token you will need to copy into the node's credentials along your instanceURL to execute your workflow.

_Token generation via your Twake Drive instance's settings is planned in future versions._
